    <h1>Computer Hardware</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Computer hardware</strong> refers to the physical components that make up a computer system. These components include the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, graphics card, and more. Without these pieces, a computer wouldn't function as it does today. The evolution of computer hardware has led to faster and more efficient systems, enabling incredible advancements in computing power. Understanding computer hardware is essential for anyone interested in technology, whether you're building your own computer or troubleshooting an existing one.

            <p>
                The CPU is the brain of the computer, handling all instructions and processes. It is responsible for executing commands from both software and hardware. Modern CPUs have multiple cores, allowing for parallel processing and better performance, especially in tasks such as gaming and video editing.

            <h2>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
            <p>
                The GPU is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations. It's particularly important for gaming, graphic design, and machine learning tasks. Unlike the CPU, the GPU specializes in parallel processing, which allows it to handle large amounts of data efficiently.
